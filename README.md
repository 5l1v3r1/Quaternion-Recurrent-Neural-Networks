# Quaternion Recurrent Neural Networks

This example trains both a Quaternion-valued RNN and a Real-valued RNN on a simple copy-task, and generates the corresponding plots.
By default, the experiments follow the experimental protocol described in the paper : [Quaternion Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04418).

Requirements
------------
A GPU with a running CUDA installation is required.
```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib      
```

Usage
------------

```bash
python copy_task.py        
```
